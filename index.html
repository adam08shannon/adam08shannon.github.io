            <p>Age: 20</p>
            <p>
                Professional Interests: I would consider myself more of a backend developer than a UI designer,
                however, I have experience with both. I am mainly interested in Software Architecture, as well
                as the challenges of managing a team following agile processes.

            <p>
                Hobbies: I am an avid rugby fan, I play at a club in Wales and will watch any and all matches
                especially if Ulster or Ireland are playing. I also enjoy reading and watching any form of crime series.

            <h3>Job Role</h3>
            <p>
                This job required me to create Power Apps using the Microsoft framework defined by users
                within the company. This included making flows for applications in development as well
                as refactoring databases in production systems. I was also involved in creating a DevOps
                pipeline for such apps using the PAC CLI. I found this thoroughly rewarding due to the
                task's complexity as there are few resources available online.
