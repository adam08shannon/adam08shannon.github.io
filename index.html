                Professional Interests: I would consider myself more of a backend developer than a UI designer,
                however, I have experience with both. I am mainly interested in Software Architecture, as well
                as the challenges of managing a team following agile processes.

                Hobbies: I am an avid rugby fan, I play at a club in Wales and will watch any and all matches
                especially if Ulster or Ireland are playing. I also enjoy reading and watching any form of crime series.
