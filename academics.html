            <h2>Year 1</h2>
            <p>
                The first year of the course required a steep learning curve. The first
                six weeks involved a large amount of rapid learning on how to create
                a website using Flask, Python, Jinja and HTML. Alongside, an
                introduction to the agile methodologies. Following this I, together
                with another 3 students, was tasked with creating a website for Simon
                Gibson. This involved tasks such as creating web pages as well as
                introducing SMTP functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester allowed me to not only develop and challenge my
                technical skills, but it also allowed me to engage with
                my peers and improve my literary ability. Additionally, this
                was my first experience with a client which allowed me to
                grow my presentation skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second semester allowed me to work on individual tasks.
                This involved touching on Java applications, self testing
                code and database design. This meant creating a wormhole
                project from a set of test requirements. This project was
                developed using Java and had to pass a pipeline which included
                code coverage tests and Checkstyle verification. Database design
                was assessed using a number of tests and a project which required
                the creation of stored procedures, triggers and views in SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester was formative in my OOP learning as well as being one
                of my first experiences with a relational database. This also inspired
                my interest in TDD.

            <h2>Year 2</h2>
            <p>
                The first semester of second year brought its own challenges,
                as again there was a rather steep learning curve.
                Building on what had been learnt in first year my Java skills were tested when I as part
                of a team was tasked with creating an employee check in portal using spring boot.
                This application challenged us to thing more about software architecture and how to effectively
                set up a project.
                Alongside this, I was also given the ability to project manage for a week.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester allowed me to begin to develop my leadership skills and also showed some of
                the issues that can arise when working in a team.
                I was able to experience some of the problems that face commercial applications, such as
                security concerns and was able to apply mitigations for these risks.
                This even included creating my own CSRF attack to prove that my CSRF protections were effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second semester android mobile development was tackled, I created a check in portal for a company.
                This entailed creating a geofence that sent a user notifications when they entered a certain area,
                the application also made use of a firebase database. DevOps and Performance and Scalability were
                other topics covered in this semester. I performed tasks such as developing a pipeline to build the application
                that was created in the first semester and writing benchmarks for this application using JMeter.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester allowed me to take a fuller look at the variables that must be considered when developing an application.
                Such as deploying the application as well as load testing the application. This semester developed my skills in the use of
                JMeter, Maven and CMD.
