            <h2>Year 1</h2>
            <p>
                The first year of the course required a steep learning curve. The first
                six weeks involved a large amount of rapid learning on how to create
                a website using Flask, Python, Jinja and HTML. Alongside, an
                introduction to the agile methodologies. Following this I, together
                with another 3 students, was tasked with creating a website for Simon
                Gibson. This involved tasks such as creating web pages as well as
                introducing SMTP functionality.

                This semester allowed me to not only develop and challenge my
                technical skills, but also it also allowed me to engage with
                my peers and improve my literary ability. Additionally, this
                was my first experience with a client which allowed me to
                grow my presentation skills.

                The second semester allowed me to work on individual tasks.
                This involved touching on Java applications, self testing
                code and database design. This meant creating a wormhole
                project from a set of test requirements. This project was
                developed using Java and had to pass a pipeline which included
                code coverage tests and Checkstyle verification. Database design
                was assessed using a number of tests and a project which required
                the creation of stored procedures, triggers and views in SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                This semester was formative in my OOP learning as well as being one
                of my first experiences with a relational database. This also inspired
                my interest in TDD.
